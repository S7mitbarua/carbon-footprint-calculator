# Carbon Footprint Calculator
The Carbon Footprint Calculator is a simple Python script that allows users to calculate their carbon footprint based on the distance they have traveled and the transportation method they used. It provides an estimation of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions generated during the trip, helping users to understand their environmental impact and make more climate-friendly choices.
# Transportation Method CO2 Values
The calculator uses the following CO2 emission values per kilometer for different transportation methods:
1. Car: 0.171 kg CO2/km
2. Bus: 0.089 kg CO2/km
3. Train: 0.04 kg CO2/km
4. Bicycle: 0 kg CO2/km (since it does not emit CO2)
